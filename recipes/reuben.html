    <h2>From New York to your kitchen, a must have sandwich.</h2>
    <p>The Reuben sandwich is a North American grilled sandwich composed of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing or Thousand Island dressing, grilled between slices of rye bread. It is associated with kosher-style delicatessens but is not kosher, as it combines meat and cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Rhodes Yeast Dinner Rolls, thawed to room temperature</li>
        <li>16 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pound thinly sliced pastrami</li>
        <li>16 ounces sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons caraway seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spray counter lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Combine 8 rolls and roll into an 11×15 inch rectangle. Place in the bottom of a sprayed 9×13 inch baking pan. Poke with a fork several times to prevent bubbles from forming. Bake at 350 degrees F 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and layer 8 slices of cheese over the baked dough. Lay pastrami on top of cheese. Combine dressing, 1 teaspoon caraway seeds, salt, pepper and sauerkraut. Spread mixture over meat. Layer the remaining 8 slices of cheese over the sauerkraut.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 8 rolls and roll into another 11×15 inch rectangle. Place dough on top of the cheese. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with remaining caraway seeds. Bake at 350 degrees F 20-25 minutes or until top is golden brown. Let cool slightly before cutting.</li>
    </ul>

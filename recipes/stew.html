    <h1>Stew</h1>

    <h2>Stew is a delicious comfort food and a common staple meal all around the world.</h2>
    <p>A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li¼cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound beef stewing meat, trimmed and cut into inch cubes</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds</li>
        <li>2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine the flour and pepper in a bowl, add the beef and toss to coat well. Heat 3 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot. Add the beef a few pieces at a time; do not overcrowd. Cook, turning the pieces until beef is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch; add more oil as needed between batches.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from the pot and add the vinegar and wine. Cook over medium-high heat, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Add the beef, beef broth and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook, skimming broth from time to time, until the beef is tender, about 1½ hours. Add the onions and carrots and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Add broth or water if the stew is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle among 4 bowls and serve.</li>
    </ul>
